I'm just uploading some of the code I'm more proud of on github rn.
This assignment probably cost me a couple of years of my life.
Got me stressing over a submarine simulator.
Wasn't in a great state of mind when working on this, still not in one but wtv.
Idk what to even put in here usually.
I hate chemistry, hopefully don't need to apply to engineering and can instead apply to computer science.
I swear chemistry is like the worst subject known to man.
Maybe I just didn't try hard enough.
I'll try harder next year.
